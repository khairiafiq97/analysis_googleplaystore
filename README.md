# analysis_googleplaystore

### How to get started 
1. Download R and an IDE for R such as RStudio 
2. Download the googleplaystore.csv file 
3. Run the code.R file in your RStudio 

### Intro of Dataset
The 'googleplaystore.csv' file has many different variables (such as Installs, Reviews etc) related to the different apps in the Google Play Store.

### Goals 
* To analyse how the different independent variables affect the response variable (I chose 'Installs' to be the response variable)
* To determine which is the biggest factor that affects the number of installs an application has. 

### Data Cleaning
